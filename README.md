# eSignature-extension-for-Espocrm
##Electronic signature for espocrm, tested on espocrm latest versions 8.0 -> Actual (8.3.5)

Module to allow the use of an electronic signature canvas as a field and to generate full page documents that incorporate the electronic signature and can be printed using the browser's PDF engine

Pasos para crear la firma electr√≥nica (eSignature) dependiendo de la entidad que quieras:

### 1. Create a new entity or edit one that you already have created, do it through the Administration panel. (I will use Ticket)

![open administrator](images/1.png?raw=true)
![open entity manager](images/2.png?raw=true)
![open your entity](images/3.png?raw=true)

### 2. Now go to fields and create a new esignature field, and named it as you want

![open fields](images/4.png?raw=true)
![create new field](images/5.png?raw=true)
![select esignature field](images/6.png?raw=true)
![put name and label](images/7.png?raw=true)

### 3. Now we have to go to the layout section and add the signature field to the design we want and put the field

![open layout](images/8.png?raw=true)
![select the layout](images/9.png?raw=true)

### 4. Now we open a ticket that we have created and we will see that we can sign, when we save the signature the date and time of the signature will appear

![select esignature field](images/10.png?raw=true)

And that is all

# Print to PDF

### 1. We create a PDF template

![put name and label](images/11.png?raw=true)

### 2.  We write the name, we select the entity case (ticket) and we select the name of the esignature field and for the signature to be seen we must use a pdf helper that I have created and is used as it appears in the photo

#### <img src="{{img_data esignaturefieldname}}">

![put name and label](images/12.png?raw=true)

### 3. We reload the page and then we go to the ticket that we have and we give the three points and we print

![put name and label](images/13.png?raw=true)
![put name and label](images/14.png?raw=true)

And that is all
